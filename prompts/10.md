### TASK: Refactor FrequencyGenerator for Initial State Stability and Weighted Markov Transitions

**1. Initial State Control:**
- Update `__init__` to accept `start_index: Optional[int] = 0`.
- In `reset()`, if `start_index` is provided, set the internal state (or `prev_state` for the first call) to this value instead of a random integer. This ensures deterministic episode starts for testing.

**2. Improved Markov Transitions (Gaussian-like Weighting):**
- In `_build_band_limited_P`, instead of `rng.choice` with `dirichlet(ones)`, implement a weighted distribution.
- For a given state $i$, the probability of jumping to state $j$ should be proportional to a Gaussian function centered at $i$:

  $$
  P_{ij} \propto \exp\left(-\frac{(i-j)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)
  $$

  where $\sigma$ is derived from `delta_limit`.
- Apply the `sparsity` mask **after** calculating these weights to keep it sparse but distance-weighted.

**3. Absorbing States Prevention:**
- After building the Markov matrix $P$, add a small epsilon (e.g. $10^{-6}$) to all cells and re-normalize the rows. This ensures no state is a "dead end" and the chain is irreducible.

**4. Code Update:**
- Please update the `next()` method to handle the first call using `self.start_index` if `prev_state` is `None`.

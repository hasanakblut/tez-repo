1. Autonomous Subband Discovery (Clustering)Methodology:This phase utilizes unsupervised learning to identify the number of active radar subbands ($M$) without prior hardware knowledge. The radar's 70/30 persistence model (staying in a subband with 70% probability) creates high-density clusters in the frequency domain, which can be distinguished from stochastic noise.Algorithms: Advanced methods such as Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are employed to capture temporal correlations.Validation: The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) or Silhouette Analysis is used to determine the optimal $N$, ensuring the discovered state-space matches the physical environment.Impact on the Problem:Structural Identification: It prevents the "mapping failure" associated with incorrect state-space definitions (e.g., treating 10 subbands as 9), which would otherwise lead to an irreducible loss in jamming success ($Num$).Autonomous Initialization: It allows the agent to self-configure its action space before the reinforcement learning loop begins.2. Curriculum Learning (CL) FrameworkMethodology:Curriculum Learning is a hierarchical training strategy that progressively increases the complexity of the task.Phase 1 (Macro-Level): Training occurs in a reduced action space ($N$ discovered subbands) to learn the primary Markovian transition patterns.Phase 2 (Complexity Scaling): Introduces a limited set of intra-pulse permutations to familiarize the agent with sub-pulse agility.Phase 3 (Full Action Space): The agent transitions to the final 240-state space, utilizing weight transfer from previous phases to initialize the policy.Impact on the Problem:Mitigating Reward Sparsity: By reducing the initial action space from 240 to $N$, the probability of receiving a positive reward increases significantly, facilitating more stable gradient updates.Optimization: This hiyerarshical approach minimizes the time spent in "random exploration" and prevents the agent from converging to suboptimal local minima.3. N-Step ReturnsMethodology:N-Step Returns serve as a mechanism to balance Bias and Variance in the temporal difference (TD) update process.The $n$-step return $$G_{t:t+n}$$ is calculated as:$$G_{t:t+n} = R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \dots + \gamma^{n-1} R_{t+n} + \gamma^n V_{t+n-1}(S_{t+n})$$Impact on the Problem:Temporal Credit Assignment: In frequency-agile sequences governed by deterministic patterns, N-step returns allow the reward from a successful jamming event at step $t+n$ to be propagated more efficiently to the decision made at step $t$.GRU Synergy: While the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) handles historical sequence dependencies, N-Step returns provide a multi-step future horizon, stabilizing the training in non-stationary Markovian environments.
